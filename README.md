## üîß Data Transformation Process

### Original Data Format
The raw dataset contained the following structure:
```
Age | Gender | Avg_Daily_Screen_Time_hr | Primary_Device | Exceeded_Recommended_Limit | Educational_to_Recreational_Ratio | Health_Impacts | Urban_or_Rural
```

**Example Original Record:**
```
14 | Male | 3.99 | Smartphone | TRUE | 0.42 | Poor Sleep, Eye Strain | Urban
```

### Data Cleaning & Transformation

#### 1. **Age Grouping**
- **Transformation:** Converted individual ages into meaningful age groups
- **Purpose:** Enable demographic analysis and pattern recognition
- **Implementation:** Created age ranges (e.g., 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17)

#### 2. **Screen Time Range Categorization**
- **Transformation:** Converted continuous screen time values into discrete ranges
- **Original:** `Avg_Daily_Screen_Time_hr: 3.99`
- **Transformed:** `Daily Screen Time Range: 3.5-4`
- **Purpose:** Simplify analysis and align with health recommendation guidelines

#### 3. **Primary Content Classification**
- **Transformation:** Derived content type from Educational_to_Recreational_Ratio
- **Logic:** 
  - If `Educational_to_Recreational_Ratio > 0.5` ‚Üí `Primary Content: Educational`
  - If `Educational_to_Recreational_Ratio ‚â§ 0.5` ‚Üí `Primary Content: Recreational`
- **Example:** `0.42 ratio ‚Üí Recreational content`

#### 4. **Health Issues Separation**
- **Transformation:** Split comma-separated health issues into individual boolean columns
- **Original:** `Health_Impacts: "Poor Sleep, Eye Strain"`
- **Transformed:** 
  - `Sleep Issues: TRUE`
  - `Eye Strain: TRUE`
  - `Anxiety: FALSE`
  - `Obesity: FALSE`
- **Purpose:** Enable granular health impact analysis and correlation studies

#### 5. **Standardized Naming**
- **Residence Area:** `Urban_or_Rural` ‚Üí `Residence Area`
- **Limit Compliance:** `Exceeded_Recommended_Limit` ‚Üí `Over Limit`

### Cleaned Data Format
```
Age Group | Gender | Daily Screen Time Range | Primary Device | Over Limit | Primary Content | Residence Area | Sleep Issues | Eye Strain | Anxiety | Obesity
```

**Example Cleaned Record:**
```
12-14 | Male | 3.5-4 | Smartphone | TRUE | Recreational | Urban | TRUE | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
```
